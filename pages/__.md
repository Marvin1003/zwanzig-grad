Try to split the RouterContext in multiple independent contexts and then debug where PureComponents are usefully placed and where not.
There are multiple ways to check how often a component rerenders. You can use a combination of componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate or static getDerivedStateFromProps or the chrome dev tools, etc.

You need to create your own private and open key in the google console of the account you want to connect to the nodemailer (auth.js) and connect it to the final url this site will have. Doesnt make sense to implement it while developing with now as you always get a new instance of the site with a new url. You would always have to unlock the url of the current instance in the google console in order to get the nodemailer working.

There might be more stuff todo and bugs which i dont think of right now or didnt discover yet.
